                <p> 
                    At Kiwi Trails and Tales, we don't just guide you through New Zealand's landscapes - we bring the stories behind them to life.
                     From the rugged coastlines carved by the sea, to the sacred peaks celebrated in Maori legends, every path has a tale to tell. 
                     Walk through history, feel the wairua (spirit) of the land, and discover adventures that go beyond the surface. With us, you'll 
                     take home more than just photos - you'll take home the stories, the connections, and the soul of Aotearoa. 
                </p>
